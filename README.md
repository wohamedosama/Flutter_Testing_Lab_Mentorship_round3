# Instructions

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Clone YOUR fork** (not this original repo)
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix-bug-1`
4. Fix the bugs in your code
5. Commit and push to YOUR fork
6. **Create a Pull Request within YOUR fork** (from your feature branch to your fork's main)
